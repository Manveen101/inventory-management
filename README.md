Manage Inventory Levels: Track real-time product quantities, ensuring that stock levels are maintained to meet customer demand.
Order Management: Handle incoming and outgoing orders, including updating stock levels based on sales or restocking.
Supplier Information: Manage supplier details and their interactions with product inventories.
Reporting: Generate insightful reports on product stock status, order fulfillment rates, and supplier performance to help businesses maintain optimal inventory levels and reduce costs.
This SQL script facilitates automated inventory control, reducing human error, and enhancing decision-making for operations and supply chain management.
